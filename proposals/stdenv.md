# Nixpkgs `stdenv` documentation – Sovereign Tech Fund

## What open source infrastructure component would you like to contribute to? Please provide more details.

[Nix](https://nix.dev/) is an open source build system, configuration management system, and mechanism for deploying software, focused on reproducibility.
It is the basis of an ecosystem of exceptionally powerful tools – including Nixpkgs, [the largest, most up-to-date software repository in the world](https://repology.org/repositories/graphs), and NixOS, a Linux distribution that can be configured fully declaratively, with unmatched flexibility.
For its proponents, Nix embodies technology sovereignty.
It is leveraged and relied upon by computer enthusiasts, professionals, and organisations who recognise its value for all steps in the software development lifecycle.

The particular component this project aims to improve is the documentation for the [Standard Environment](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#part-stdenv), [Build Helpers](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#part-builders), and [library reference](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#id-1.4) in Nixpkgs.
The standard environment forms the technical foundation for the massive package collection, and is augmented by build helpers that allow packaging software from various [language ecosystems](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#chap-language-support) and reliably [cross-compile](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#chap-cross) software.
These areas are at the core of Nix’s unique strengths, and the daily driver of developers leveraging Nixpkgs to secure repeatable production of artefacts.

## Why is this technology critical? Please explain to us the relevance of this technology.

This year Nix has seen its 20th anniversary.
We estimate the community to consist of 100 mostly volunteer developers, 2 000 contributors, more than 15 000 active users, and 100 companies using and relying on Nix.
[Recent social media activity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuWPuJZ9NcU) reaches on the order of 100 000 people.
The Nix ecosystem is on an [exponential growth trajectory](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/NixOS/nixpkgs#overview) in terms of user adoption and development activity at the periphery.

Nix has the potential to become a default in the software development tool stack, by drastically reducing the time required to start working on software development projects – written in any language – and the cost of maintaining and sharing build setups and development environments.
These can build on top of Nixpkgs, which today supplies the largest collection of free software in existence ready for use.
Packages and services can be configured and deployed through NixOS more flexibly, reliably, efficiently than with any comparable tool.
The Nix ecosystem can enable almost indefinite reproducibility of builds and configurations: [Nix and legacy enterprise software development: an unlikely match made in heaven](https://talks.nixcon.org/nixcon-2022/talk/QQPBFW/).

It serves as the platform accelerating and keeping usable countless software experiments that would otherwise be intractable or have long become inaccessible as their environments grow past them.

Moreover, the public [Nix binary cache](http://cache.nixos.org/) provides operational software artefacts from more than a decade back, some of which cannot be obtained otherwise any more.

In short, Nix reduces the global cost of software production and long-term use by a tangible amount.

## Who benefits from this technology and the improvements or contributions? Which target groups does your project address (who are its users?) and how do they benefit from the funding (directly and indirectly)?

Tools in the Nix ecosystem are primarily suited to professional software developers (and computer enthusiasts, many of which are students), but are also known to support scientific work, and are used as a foundational technology and force multiplier in a multitude of organisations and commercial enterprises.
All these are direct or indirect beneficiaries of improved developer-oriented documentation, through reduced onboarding time, learning effort, and costs of solving common problems, which overall reduces the cost of software development.

The NLnet Foundation is partnering with the NixOS Foundation to leverage Nix’s capabilities for providing sustainably accessible software under the umbrella of the Next Generation Internet initiative of the European Commission.
This year, the third instalment of the [Summer of Nix](https://github.com/ngi-nix/summer-of-nix/) program will be held, making even more software available through Nix and upskilling dozens of participants (see also the [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20220927101525/https://summer.nixos.org/) and [documentation program](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/summer-of-nix-documentation-stream/20351) announcement for 2022).
Better reference documentation of Nixpkgs build tooling can be expected to also tangibly reduce the cost of training and development work for the next two years’ programs, which are already funded.

## How are decisions regarding this technology’s development made? Please describe the project’s governance model.

Individuals and loosely organised contributor or maintainer teams review each other’s work and discuss technical decisions in public.
Despite the principal author technically being a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), there are only weak and implicit power structures that are largely centered around demonstrated achievements, and decisions largely are based on technical merit as judged by those involved.

Self-organised formal [community teams](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams) take responsibility for maintaining code in their areas of expertise, and have a more formal communication and permission structure.
Otherwise, apart from more regular activity, they operate just like any other group of contributors.

Ecosystem-wide technical decisions are negotiated in an [RFC process](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/).

The NixOS Foundation mainly ensures funding for critical assets such as the binary cache, manages permissions in the GitHub organisation, and facilitates community activities.
The Foundation board as a legal entity is not involved in technical decisions.

Project governance has immensely gained in structure lately: In the past year, four of the eleven currently active community teams were formed, the NixOS Foundation board was restructured, and there exist plans for setting up paid support functions to ensure continued operations.

## How does this project handle security risks? Are there policies, procedures, or tools in place to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities or undesired contributions?

There exists a [security team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/security.html) and an [infrastructure team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/infrastructure.html) tending to critical assets.
[Security-relevant issues and pull-requests](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/labels/1.severity%3A%20security) are automatically tagged by a [vulnerability tracking system](https://github.com/nix-community/vulnix/).

Different components have different ownership structures.
For Nix itself, only maintainers have write access, and only the principal author can publish releases.
Nixpkgs and NixOS have a much broader committer community with largely implicit rules.
There is a high degree of social trust involved, and active developers and maintainers, while culturally and geographically diverse, usually have ongoing working relationships marked by diligent reviews and critical discussions.

## How will you address the challenge described? Give an overview of your work and why it is significant, specifically addressing the challenge. Explain what the field will learn from your proposed work and how it contributes to the long-term sustainability of the technology.

In the past, Nix gained an unfortunate reputation of having a steep learning curve and unhelpful documentation.
The Nix documentation team was [established in mid 2022](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documentation-team-flattening-the-learning-curve/20003) in order to ease learning Nix for beginners and support community efforts in that direction.
In the past months the team has gathered many active contributors following a [call for maintainers](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documentation-team-call-for-maintainers/25970), and successfully ran a [fundraiser to support a focused project](https://opencollective.com/nixos/projects/documentation-project) aiming to improve the onboarding experience for new users.
This is testimony that users are invested in the ecosystem, care for better documentation, and trust maintainers to execute on their plans.

While the mentioned chapters in the Nixpkgs manual are central to the entire ecosystem and critically important early on in user onboarding, they are by far the weakest parts of documentation and a clear hindrance to adoption – well known among new users, contributors, and maintainers for lack of crucial information, poor discoverability, and densely written text full of unfamiliar concepts and terminology (to the point of being the subject of [elaborate mockery](https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/)).
Most importantly, this part of documentation is **effectively unmaintained** as currently no one has the resources to take ownership due to its enormous size.

Nixpkgs is a large software project, and one of the largest public GitHub repositories.
The code itself originated from research projects in [2004](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/nspfssd-lisa2004-final.pdf) and [2006](https://nixos.org/docs/SCR-2005-091.pdf), and albeit always serving its purpose, for various reasons has grown without clear direction since and saw, at best, sparse efforts to provide approachable documentation.
The documentation team is now at a crucial point where we have built up enough capacity, expertise, and community support to tackle the skill-based problem of producing correct and helpful documentation and presenting it in appropriate locations;
we also have built up enough organisational structures and routines to deal with the coordination problem of incrementally reorganising a large information system in a division of labor.

This project aims for a complete revision of the [Standard Environment](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#part-stdenv), [Build Helpers](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#part-builders), and [library reference](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#id-1.4) chapters in the Nixpkgs manual, and do other clean-up work in context.
Specific goals are, roughly in order of importance:

- Clarify key concepts, mechanisms, and common use cases
- Improve structure and language
- Ensure that the entire API surface is visible
- Increase discoverability and cross-linking
- Provide examples
- Plan and implement renamings as needed
- Augment contribution guides
- Improve visual presentation
- Improve development infrastructure and workflows for documentation
    - Automatic testing of examples
    - Stable URLs and automatic redirects
    - Better automatic rendering of in-code comments
- Improve contribution workflows

Since these manual chapters are currently unmaintained and (to our knowledge) there exists no person who knows them completely, a significant part of the initial work will consist of reading source code, mapping out concepts and key use cases, as well as planning and coordinating changes.
It will be followed by work on correctly representing concepts (which cannot be parallelised) and improving superficial structure and language (which can be parallelised well).
This will be accompanied by deep structural changes once the team gets more into the context.
Another major aspect will be technical changes addressign problems with discoverability, visual presentation, and contributor experience, the work on which can run in parallel to the editorial effort.

The Nix documentation team has a track record of achieving substantial improvements over long stretches of time-constrained work, which we document in various reports, for example:

- [This Month in Nix Docs #3 – May/June 2023](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/this-month-in-nix-docs-3-may-june-2023/29958/1)
- [Tweag+Nix dev update #47 (also covering documentation)](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/tweag-nix-dev-update-47/27387#documentation-2)
- [Nix team report 2022-10 — 2023-03 (also covering documentation)](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-team-report-2022-10-2023-03/27486#documentation-14)
- [Four months into the Nix Book](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-09-29-the-nix-book-report/)

### What the field will learn from our work

With support of the NixOS Foundation, the Nix documentation team not only works on improving technical documentation and creating educational content, but also continues driving organisational maturity of the ecosystem by setting examples of running community-driven teams [fully in the open](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/documentation/25) and connecting domain experts with new users and contributors.
We hope that with carrying out a large project, we can demonstrate

- Public collaboration across organisational boundaries on a valuable shared resource
- Application of best practices in developer-focused documentation in a realistic setting

to the wider open source and software development community.

### How our work will contribute to sustainability of Nix and Nixpkgs

Software developers are a broadly agreed-upon target audience for Nix community teams:
Keeping the ecosystem on a healthy trajectory while keeping to established stability standards requires highly specialised knowledge, and attracting volunteer talent is critical for sustaining maintenance and development of core components.
This project will contribute to solving part of the succession problem in the Nix ecosystem, both by reducing effort and friction for existing users and contributors, and by increasing attractiveness to new users who may become contributors and eventually graduate to take on maintainer responsibility.
Making Nix and Nixpkgs more approachable and easier to use will also make it more likely for organisations to adopt the technology, and in turn invest resources to support ongoing development, as we have already observed as results of our work in the past year.

Explanation:
Based on experience we plan enough time for reviews on technical design, implementations, and editorial work.
In particular, we plan budget to secure time from maintainers of individual components in order to make sure that we get timely reviews and our changes to documentation are correct.
This is incorporated in the calculation.
We assume software developer rates also for most editorial work, as editing the documentation content requires specific expertise, and those knowledgable in our problem domains are usually employed at consultancies.

To validate that the work done indeed constitutes improvements, we will run another usability study to follow up on [an initial assessment of documentation quality from 2022](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/usability-studies/21404).

## Describe your relationship to the maintainers of this technology. Are you yourself the maintainer? Do they know you plan to do this work and do they support it? Please tell us more about how you obtained their support and how you plan to work together to make sure your contributions are accepted.

This project proposal was developed and written collaboratively by the Nix documentation team, which is responsible for all official Nix documentation, and will lead and coordinate the activities proposed here.

I am founding member and current lead of the documentation team, and also participate in the Nix maintainers team.
The problems outlined here are well known to all maintainers, but due to lack of resources, solutions have been proposed and discussed but not implemented.

Fundraising activities are agreed-upon and welcomed: preparations for the grant applications were [announced in the community forum](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/german-federal-funding-for-foss-development/29036/4), with support of the NixOS Foundation board:

> While the NixOS Foundation board is not involved in technical decisions in the Nix ecosystem, we strongly support these proposed efforts to solve long-standing issues and trust the authors of these proposals to implement them as described.
> We are convinced that succeeding with these projects will enable more reliable software infrastructure and support its long-term maintenance both in the Nix ecosystem as well as for projects relying on it.
